# Overview
This algorithms solves the [sorting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm). The input and output of a sorting algorithm is defined below:

* Input: A sequence of $n$ numbers $\langle a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n\rangle$.
* Output: A permutation (reordering) $\langle a_1', a_2',\ldots, a_n'\rangle$ of the input sequence such that $a_1'\leq a_2'\leq\cdots\leq a_n'$.

The numbers to be sorted are also known as **keys**. Keys are often associated with satellite data. In a database, rows are usually sorted by ID number (the satellite data being the information associated with the ID number). Together, the kay and its associated satellite data is known as a **record**.
# Insertion Sort Pseudocode
The following is the pseudocode for the insertion sort algorithm:

```
INSERTION-SORT(A, n)
	for i = 2 to n
		key = A[i]
		// Insert A[i] into the subarray A[1:i-1].
		j = i - 1
		while j > 0 and A[j] > key
			A[j + 1] = A[j]
			j = j - 1
		A[j + 1] = key
```

The way that this algorithm works is by looking at each key `A[i]` from $\{i\in\mathbb Z\ | \ 2\leq i\leq n\}$. For each key, the algorithm iteratively looks to the left of the key until it finds a key that is less than or equal to the current key.
